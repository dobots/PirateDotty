 * @brief 
 * @file IRTalk.cpp
 *
 * This file is created at Almende B.V. and Distributed Organisms B.V. It is open-source software and belongs to a
 * larger suite of software that is meant for research on self-organization principles and multi-agent systems where
 * learning algorithms are an important aspect.
 *
 * This software is published under the GNU Lesser General Public license (LGPL).
 *
 * It is not possible to add usage restrictions to an open-source license. Nevertheless, we personally strongly object
 * against this software being used for military purposes, factory farming, animal experimentation, and "Universal
 * Declaration of Human Rights" violations.
